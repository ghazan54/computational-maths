# Newton's Interpolation Method

**Newton's Interpolation Method** is an algorithm used for interpolating the value of a function between two known data points. It involves constructing a polynomial function that passes through the data points and then evaluating the function at a desired point.

## Algorithm

Given a set of data points (x0, y0), (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn), where x and y are the independent and dependent variables, respectively, and xi is the desired point to interpolate.

1. Define the divided difference table d[i,j] = (d[i+1,j-1] - d[i,j-1])/(x[i+j] - x[i]) for i = 0, 1, ..., n-j and j = 1, 2, ..., n.
2. Compute the coefficients of the polynomial using d[0,0], d[1,1], ..., d[n,n].
3. Evaluate the polynomial at the desired point xi using the formula:
  P(xi) = d[0,0] + (xi - x[0])d[1,1] + (xi - x[0])(xi - x[1])d[2,2] + ... + (xi - x[0])(xi - x[1])...(xi - x[n-1])d[n,n]

## Example

Suppose we have the following set of data points: (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16). We want to find the value of the function at x = 2.5 using Newton's Interpolation Method.
1. Constructing the divided difference table

| x | y  | d[0,1] | d[1,1] | d[0,2] | d[1,2] | d[2,2] | d[0,3] |
|---|----|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 1  | 3      | 4      | -2     | 1.5    |        |        |
| 2 | 4  | 5      | 5      | 3      |        |        |        |
| 3 | 9  | 7      |        |        |        |        |        |
| 4 | 16 |        |        |        |        |        |        |

2. Computing the coefficients of the polynomial

Using the divided difference table, we can compute the coefficients of the polynomial as follows:

P(x) = 1 + 3(x - 1) + 1(x - 1)(x - 2) - 1/2(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)

3. Evaluating the polynomial at x = 2.5

Substituting x = 2.5 into the polynomial, we get:

P(2.5) = 1 + 3(2.5 - 1) + 1(2.5 - 1)(2.5 - 2) - 1/2(2.5 - 1)(2.5 - 2)(2.5 - 3) = 6.875

Therefore, the value of the function at x = 2.5 using Newton's Interpolation Method is 6.875.
