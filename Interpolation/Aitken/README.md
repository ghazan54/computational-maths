# Aitken's Interpolation Method

**Aitken's interpolation** is a method for approximating a value between two known data points. It is an extension of the linear interpolation method where instead of using a straight line between the two points, a polynomial curve is used. This method is named after the mathematician Alexander Aitken.

## Algorithm

Given a set of data points (x0, y0), (x1, y1), ... (xn, yn), where x0 < x1 < ... < xn, and a value x, where x_i < x < x_i+1 for some i, we want to approximate the value of y at x.

1. Calculate the first and second forward differences for the data points:
  * First forward difference: f[i] = y[i+1] - y[i]
  * Second forward difference: s[i] = f[i+1] - f[i]

2. Use Aitken's formula to compute the interpolated value of y at x:
  * y = y_i + (x - x_i) * f[i] + (x - x_i) * (x - x_i+1) * s[i] / (x_i+2 - x_i)

## Example

Suppose we have the following data points: (1, 4), (2, 5), and (4, 3). We want to approximate the value of y at x = 3.

1. Calculate the first and second forward differences:
  * First forward difference: f[0] = 5 - 4 = 1, f[1] = 3 - 5 = -2
  * Second forward difference: s[0] = -2 - 1 = -3

2. Use Aitken's formula to compute the interpolated value of y at x = 3:
  * y = 5 + (3 - 2) * 1 + (3 - 2) * (3 - 4) * (-3) / (4 - 1) = 4

Therefore, the interpolated value of y at x = 3 is approximately 4.
